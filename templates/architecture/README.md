# 📁 architecture — Technical Documentation and Engineering Decisions

This directory contains the project's **technical architecture documentation**.  
It serves as the bridge between the planning phase (`planning/`) and the execution phase (`logs/` and `automation/`).  
It provides clear, complete documentation of **how** the system is built, **why** it is built that way,  
and how architectural decisions are recorded and managed throughout the project's lifecycle.

---

## Purpose of the Directory

- Define the system’s engineering structure and its layers.  
- Document architectural decisions (ADR) and the reasoning behind them.  
- Maintain full transparency between business planning, logical specification and actual implementation.  
- Provide a reference point for any future change, investigation or revision.  
- Enable the agent to understand the system’s structure and operate within defined boundaries.

## File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **ARCHITECTURE_BLUEPRINT_TEMPLATE.md** | Describes the system structure, layers and core technologies. |
| **ADR_TEMPLATE.md** | Used for documenting Architectural Decision Records (ADRs). |
| **README.md** | This file — explains the purpose of the directory and its relation to other layers. |

> Files inside `docs/architecture/` are generated from these templates  
> and managed directly under version control (Git) with full tracking in the execution log (`IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`).

## Role of the Architecture Layer

- The **Blueprint** documents the system as designed and implemented.  
- The **ADRs** capture the rationale behind decisions that shaped the system.  
- Together, they form a **living documentation layer** that lets anyone understand past decisions — even years later.

> The agent uses these documents to understand system structure, analyze dependencies,  
> and ensure every change complies with the planned architecture and approved boundaries.

## Integration With Other Layers

| Layer | Role Within Architecture |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **planning/** | Provides business requirements and logical reasoning on which the architecture is based. |
| **logs/** | Records all implementations, changes and exceptions that occurred in practice. |
| **automation/** | Produces periodic reports and validations using architectural information. |
| **agent/** | The agent relies only on approved Blueprint and ADR documents when performing actions. |

---

## Core Principle

> Every decision must have reasoning.  
> Every structure must be documented.  
> Every change must be linked back to its source.

Architecture is the **shared language** between humans, agents and code.  
It anchors the system’s intent, ensures consistency  
and enables real oversight over how the system is built, evolves and is maintained over time.
