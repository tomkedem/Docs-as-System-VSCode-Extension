# Implementation Log

**Actual project document:** `docs/logs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`  
**Template location:** `templates/logs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG_TEMPLATE.md`  
**Purpose:** To automatically document every action, change or decision in the project in real time  
**Related files:**  
- `docs/agent/AGENT_OPERATIONAL_POLICY.md`  
- `docs/agent/HUMAN_OPERATIONAL_POLICY.md`  
- `docs/security/SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md`  
- `docs/validation/VALIDATION_REPORT.md`

## Operational principle

This file is generated and updated automatically by the agent in real time  
based on data from Git, CI pipelines and self validation runs.

The human is not required to fill records manually.  
Their role is only to approve, add context or correct exceptions when needed.  
Every entry becomes part of the project history and is never overwritten.
