# 📁 project — wrapper documents, compliance and general policy

This folder contains the management level wrapper documents of every Docs as System project.  
It describes the identity of the project, its boundaries, its compliance rules  
and the framework in which the human and the agent operate together under continuous control and documentation.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the folder

- Define the **identity of the project** and its business or organizational context.  
- Maintain a clear policy of **compliance, control and responsibility**.  
- Enable full transparency between humans and agents.  
- Centralize all governance and compliance documents in one place.  
- Serve as a central anchor for version management, alignment and change tracking.

## ⚙️ Note about licensing and contribution

The licensing and citation documents (`LICENSE.md`, `CITATION.cff`)  
are managed at the **root level of the Docs as System repository**  
and therefore are not part of this template.  

Contribution and review processes are managed through the agent operational policy (`AGENT_OPERATIONAL_POLICY.md`)  
and not through a separate `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

> There is no need for licensing or contribution files inside the `project` folder.  
> The methodology itself already defines the rules at the system level.

## 🏁 Summary

The `project` folder is the **governance layer** of Docs as System.  
It defines the identity of the project and the operational boundaries  
and connects documentation, development and organizational control into one coherent structure.
